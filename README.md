## Contribution Guidlines
### How to contribute?
1. Fork the repository
2. Make the desired changes (add/delete/modify)
3. Make a pull request

### When to contribute?
1. If there is no solution to a problem in either C++ or Python in the main branch
2. If your solution to an existing problem is asymptotically faster than the one in the main branch
3. If your algorithm has the same time complexity but with reduced code size. In such cases comment the original solution and make a pull request with your solution
4. if your method of solving asymptotically slower then comment your solution and make a pull request
